# cmsNode

Simple cms I've built for a friend so he could add some data to his SQL database.

Project also contains 2 apis, one to fetch that data from database, and another to send email so people visiting his website could contact him.

CMS is protected thanks to passport authentication, and express session.

To connect with database Ive used Sequelize.

Whole "front" is SSR'ed thanks to nodeJs express ejs.
